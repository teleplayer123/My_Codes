Backdoor Example:
----
This is a simple python implementation of a "backdoor", which is a program that an attacker
uses to gain entry to a victims server where access would not usually be permitted. In order to be effective, 
an attacker would likely hide a backdoor in a program that a victim may install to their computer.
